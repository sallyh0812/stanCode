This program asks our user for input and checks if the input is a
prime number or not. At the beginning, ”Run? ” is printed on Console
and waits the user to enter ’Y’ or ’N’ (”Illegal format.” for anything else)
If the user entered ’Y’, ”n: ” is printed on Console and waits the user to
enter an integer that is greater than 1 and checks if it is a prime number.
If the user entered ’N’, ”Have a good one!” is printed on Console
