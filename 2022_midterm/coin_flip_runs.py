-----------------------
This program should simulate coin flip(s) with the number of runs input by users. A
'run' is defined as consecutive results on either 'H' or 'T'. For example,
â€˜HHHHHTHTT' is regarded as a 2-run result. Your program should stop immediately
after your coin flip results reach the number of runs!
